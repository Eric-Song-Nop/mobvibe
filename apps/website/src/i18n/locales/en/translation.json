					"role": "assistant",
					"content": "Mobvibe connects to **AI coding agents** running on any of your machines through a central gateway. Each machine runs a lightweight CLI daemon that registers with the gateway, making all your development environments accessible from a single interface.\n\nYou can switch between machines instantly, run commands remotely, and manage sessions across your entire fleet — whether it's a local workstation, a cloud VM, or a headless server."

As the agent thinks and writes code, you see every character appear instantly — no waiting for the full response.\n\nThis includes:\n- **Markdown rendering** as it streams\n- **Syntax-highlighted code blocks** that build up live\n- **Tool call results** that expand inline\n- **Thinking indicators** while the agent reasons"

Sessions persist across reconnections — if your browser disconnects, you pick up right where you left off.\n\nYou can:\n- Create new sessions on any connected machine\n- **Rename** sessions for easy reference\n- **Archive** sessions you're done with\n- Switch between active sessions instantly"

					"role": "assistant",
					"content": "Type `@` in the message input to trigger the file picker. As you type, it filters matching files from the session's working directory. Select a file, and it gets attached as context — the agent sees the file's contents along with your message.\n\nThis is perfect for saying things like \"refactor `@utils.ts` to use async/await\"."

					"content": "Mobvibe supports **end-to-end encryption (E2EE)** using proven cryptographic primitives (XSalsa20-Poly1305, X25519, Ed25519). When enabled, messages are encrypted on the CLI daemon before transmission and decrypted only in your browser.\n\nThe gateway **never sees plaintext** — it only relays encrypted payloads. This means even if the gateway is compromised, your code and conversations remain private."

After the handshake, a shared secret is derived and used for **XChaCha20-Poly1305** authenticated encryption.\n\nNo keys are ever stored on the gateway. Each session establishes a fresh keypair, providing forward secrecy."

Desktop and mobile apps get a few extras:\n\n- **Native notifications** when the agent completes a task\n- **Deep linking** to open sessions directly\n- **Persistent storage** for offline access to session history\n- **System theme** integration that follows your OS appearance\n\nThe web version works great too — it's the easiest way to get started."

It's designed to be:\n\n- **Transport-agnostic** — works over WebSocket, HTTP, or stdio\n- **Extensible** — new message types can be added without breaking existing clients\n- **Streaming-first** — all responses support incremental delivery\n- **Secure** — optional E2EE layer built into the protocol"

You can:\n\n- Build custom frontends that connect to any Mobvibe gateway\n- Create CLI tools that interact with agents programmatically\n- Integrate agent capabilities into your existing tools and workflows\n\nThe `@mobvibe/shared` package provides TypeScript types for all protocol messages."
