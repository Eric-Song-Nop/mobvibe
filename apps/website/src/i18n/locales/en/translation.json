					"role": "assistant",
					"content": "Mobvibe is a **remote AI coding agent management platform**. It lets you monitor and control AI agents (like Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI) running on any of your machines — from a single web or native interface.\n\nThe architecture is simple:\n- **CLI daemon** runs alongside your agent on each machine\n- **Gateway** relays messages between CLI and frontends\n- **WebUI / Desktop / Mobile** provides the unified interface\n\nEverything is open source, and you can self-host the entire stack."

				},
				{
					"role": "assistant",
					"content": "Using agents directly in the terminal works, but Mobvibe adds several layers on top:\n\n- **Unified interface** — manage sessions across all machines from one place\n- **Session persistence** — reconnect anytime without losing context\n- **End-to-end encryption** — your code stays private, even from the gateway\n- **Real-time streaming** — see agent output token by token with rich rendering\n- **File explorer** — browse remote files, use @mentions to reference them\n- **Git integration** — view diffs, blame, branches without leaving the UI\n- **Permission approval** — review and approve tool calls before they execute"

Any agent that speaks ACP can plug into Mobvibe — new agents can be added without modifying the platform."

Each machine runs its own agent independently, so you can have:\n\n- Claude Code on your main workstation\n- Codex on a cloud VM\n- Gemini CLI on another server\n\nAll sessions appear in the same sidebar, grouped by machine. You can switch between agents instantly and even compare their approaches to the same task."

Generate an **Ed25519 keypair** for secure signing\n4. Register your machine with the gateway\n\nOnce logged in, the CLI daemon starts automatically and your machine appears in the web UI at **app.mobvibe.net**."

This is the fastest way to get started.\n\nIf you want full control, you can self-host:\n- The gateway is a Node.js + Express + Socket.io server\n- PostgreSQL for persistence\n- Deploy anywhere — Docker, Render, or bare metal\n\nJust set `MOBVIBE_GATEWAY_URL` in your CLI config to point to your own instance."

After the Diffie-Hellman exchange, a shared secret is derived and used for symmetric encryption.\n\nKey properties:\n- **No keys stored on gateway** — it only relays the handshake\n- **Forward secrecy** — each session uses fresh keypairs\n- **Automatic setup** — E2EE is negotiated transparently when both sides support it\n\nYou can verify the encryption status in the session header — a lock icon confirms E2EE is active."

Here's the workflow:\n\n1. **Create** — click \"New Session\" and select a machine + working directory\n2. **Chat** — interact with the agent, send code references with @mentions\n3. **Rename** — give sessions meaningful names for easy reference\n4. **Archive** — hide completed sessions without deleting them\n\nSessions persist across reconnections. If your browser disconnects, you pick up right where you left off — full message history, agent context, everything."

When you reconnect:\n\n- All previous messages are restored instantly\n- The agent retains its context\n- File references and @mentions remain valid\n- You can continue the conversation seamlessly\n\nThis makes Mobvibe ideal for long-running tasks — start a refactoring session in the morning, review progress in the evening, all from any device."

Type `@` in the message input to trigger the file picker, then start typing — it matches filenames, paths, and even partial fragments.\n\nThe command palette (`Ctrl+K`) provides the same search across all files in the working directory. Results are ranked by relevance, and you can navigate with keyboard shortcuts.\n\nSelected files get attached as context — the agent sees their contents along with your message. Perfect for requests like \"refactor `@utils.ts` to use async/await\"."
